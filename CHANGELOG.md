# Changelog

What's new, what's better, what's different. Most recent stuff on top.

---

## 0.9.2 — The Front Door

The SKILL.md frontmatter was broken — missing closing delimiters and markdown syntax mixed into the YAML. The `add-skill` CLI couldn't parse the skill metadata properly. Now it's valid YAML frontmatter that tools can actually read.

- Fixed SKILL.md frontmatter: removed `##` from name field, added closing `---`
- Cleaned up upstream URL (was wrapped in a markdown link inside YAML)

## 0.9.1 — The Gatekeeper

Keywords like "version" and "changelog" were sneaking past the routing table and getting treated as task content. Fixed by reordering the routing table so keyword patterns are checked before the descriptive-content catch-all, and added explicit priority language so agents match keywords first.

- Routing table now has numbered priority — first match wins, top to bottom
- "Descriptive content" catch-all moved to last position (priority 7)
- Step 2 clarifies that single keywords matching the table are routed actions, not content
- Fixes: `do work version` no longer asks "Add this as a request?"

## 0.9.0 — The Rewind

You can now ask "what's new" and actually see what's new — right at the bottom of your terminal where you're already looking. The version action gained changelog display with a twist: it reverses the entries so the latest changes land at the bottom of the output, no scrolling required. Portable across skills — any project with a CHANGELOG.md gets this for free.

- Changelog display added to the version action: `do work changelog`, `release notes`, `what's new`, `updates`, `history`
- Entries print oldest-to-newest so the most recent version appears at the bottom of terminal output
- Routing table updated with changelog keyword detection
- Works with any skill that has a CHANGELOG.md in its root

## 0.8.0 — The Clarity Pass

The UR system was hiding in plain sight — documented everywhere but easy to miss if you weren't reading carefully. This release restructures the do action and skill definition so the UR + REQ pairing is unmissable, even for agents that skim. Also added agent compatibility guidance to CLAUDE.md so future edits keep the skill portable across platforms.

- Added "Required Outputs" section to top of do.md — UR + REQ pairing stated upfront as mandatory
- Restructured Step 5 Simple Mode — UR creation now has equal weight with REQ creation
- Added Do Action Checklist at end of workflow — mirrors the work action's orchestrator checklist
- Moved UR anti-patterns to general "What NOT To Do" section (was under complex-only)
- Updated SKILL.md with core concept callout about UR + REQ pairing
- Added Agent Compatibility section to CLAUDE.md — generalized language, standalone-prompt design, floor-not-ceiling

## 0.7.0 — The Nudge

Complex requests now get a gentle suggestion to run `/do-work verify` after capture. If your input had lots of features, nuanced constraints, or multiple REQs, the system lets you know verification is available — so you can catch dropped details before building starts. Simple requests stay clean and quiet.

- Verify hint added to do action's report step for meaningfully complex requests
- Triggers on: complex mode, 3+ REQ files, or notably long/nuanced input
- Two complex examples updated to show the hint in action
- No change for simple requests — no hint, no noise

## 0.6.0 — The Bouncer

Working and archive folders are now off-limits. Once a request is claimed by a builder or archived, nobody can reach in and modify it — not even to add "one more thing." If you forgot something, it goes in as a new addendum request that references the original. Clean boundaries, no mid-flight surprises.

- Files in `working/` and `archive/` are now explicitly immutable
- New `addendum_to` frontmatter field for follow-up requests
- Do action checks request location before deciding how to handle duplicates
- Work action reinforces immutability in its folder docs

## 0.5.0 — The Record Keeper

Now you can see what changed and when. Added this very changelog so the project has a memory. CLAUDE.md got updated with rules to keep it honest — every version bump gets a changelog entry, no exceptions.

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` with full retroactive history
- Updated commit workflow: version bump → changelog entry → commit

## 0.4.0 — The Organizer

The archive got a brain. New **cleanup action** automatically tidies your archive at the end of every work loop — closing completed URs, sweeping loose REQs into their folders, and herding legacy files where they belong. Also introduced the **User Request (UR) system** that groups related REQs under a single umbrella, so your work has structure from capture to completion.

- Cleanup action: `do work cleanup` (or automatic after every work loop)
- UR system: related REQs now live under UR folders with shared context
- Routing expanded: cleanup/tidy/consolidate keywords recognized
- Work loop exit now triggers automatic archive consolidation

## 0.3.0 — Self-Aware

The skill learned its own version number. New **version action** lets you check what you're running and whether there's an update upstream. Documentation got a glow-up too.

- Version check: `do work version`
- Update check: `do work check for updates`
- Improved docs across the board

## 0.2.0 — Trust but Verify

Added a **testing phase** to the work loop and clarified what the orchestrator is (and isn't) responsible for. REQs now get validated before they're marked done.

- Testing phase baked into the work loop
- Clearer orchestrator responsibilities
- Better separation of concerns

## 0.1.1 — Typo Patrol

Fixed a username typo in the installation command. Small but important — can't install a skill if the command is wrong.

- Fixed: incorrect username in `npx install-skill` command

## 0.1.0 — Hello, World

The beginning. Core task capture and processing system with do/work routing, REQ file management, and archive workflow.

- Task capture via `do work <description>`
- Work loop processing with `do work run`
- REQ file lifecycle: pending → working → archived
- Git-aware: auto-commits after each completed request
