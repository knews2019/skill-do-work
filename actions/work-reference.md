# Work Action — Reference

> Companion file to `work.md`. Holds the heavy templates, tables, and sub-procedures the orchestrator references by name — extracted to keep `actions/work.md` focused on the ten-step skeleton. Each section below is pointed to from the matching step in `actions/work.md`. Loading this file is only necessary when you reach the step that references it.

id: REQ-001
title: Short descriptive title
status: pending
domain: frontend  # choose one: frontend, backend, ui-design, general, security, or testing
tdd: false       # optional — set true when test-first applies (per capture's TDD heuristic); drives Step 6 testing-crew loading and RED/GREEN mode
caveman: false   # optional — `true` or intensity `lite` | `full` | `ultra`; loads crew-members/caveman.md to compress agent prose

user_request: UR-001          # May be absent on legacy REQs
addendum_to: REQ-NNN          # optional — present only when this REQ amends an in-flight or completed REQ; set by capture, or by review when creating follow-ups. **Legacy alias:** every read site (Step 8 upstream walk, Step 8 cycle detection, Step 8 follow-up generation, and roadmap Blocked classification) also recognizes `amends:`, `parent:`, and `amendment_to:` as synonyms when `addendum_to` is absent so natural-English glosses don't silently drop the parent linkage; `addendum_to` wins when multiple are present. Capture and follow-up REQs always emit `addendum_to:` — never propagate the alias.
depends_on: []                # optional list of REQ IDs that must reach `completed` or `completed-with-issues` before this REQ runs. Semantically distinct from `addendum_to` ("amends that REQ"): depends_on is "requires that REQ to be done first." A REQ can have both. Honored by Step 1's selection scan and by Step 8's upstream-failure classification. **Legacy alias:** every read site (Step 1 selection, Step 1 cycle detection, Step 1 `--wave` depth, Step 8 upstream walk, roadmap classification) also recognizes a `dependencies:` key as a synonym so muscle-memory typos from Python/Node/Cargo conventions don't silently bypass gating; `depends_on` wins when both are present. Capture and follow-up REQs always emit `depends_on:` — never propagate the alias.

## Schema Read Contract

Seven fields above are enum-or-boolean-valued, and an audit of `0.76.2`'s `dependencies:` → `depends_on` patch surfaced that several silently swallow natural typo variants from sister conventions (snake_case vs kebab-case YAML, `done`/`finished`/`closed` as English glosses of `completed`, lowercase route letters, etc.). Pure silent-alias is risky for enum values because an unknown value should not be quietly remapped — it should leave a footprint. Every read site in this file (and in `actions/roadmap.md`) honors a uniform **normalize-and-warn contract** for these fields:

1. **Normalize first.** Apply the per-field alias map below. If a canonical match results, use it silently.
2. **Warn-on-fallback.** If after normalization the value still doesn't match the canonical enum, emit:

   ```
   ⚠ {field}: '{value}' not recognized — expected one of [{enum}]. Treating as '{default}'.
   ```

   and proceed with the documented default.
3. **Never silently drop.** The warning is the missing feedback channel that allowed `dependencies:` to go unnoticed pre-0.76.2. Warnings render in the queue-status summary block (Step 1) or, for fields read outside Step 1, alongside the operation that triggered the read.

| Field (read sites) | Canonical enum | Normalization | Default on unknown |
|---|---|---|---|
| `domain` (Step 4 Route C plan-agent spawn, Step 6 crew load, Step 9 review-work spawn) | `frontend`, `backend`, `ui-design`, `general`, `security`, `testing` | `back-end`/`back_end` → `backend`; `front-end`/`front_end` → `frontend`; `ui_design` → `ui-design`; `sec` → `security`; `test` → `testing` | `general` |
| `status` (Step 1 scan + categorization, Step 10 archive trigger) | `pending`, `claimed`, `completed`, `completed-with-issues`, `failed`, `pending-answers`, `blocked-archive-collision`, `blocked-dependency-cycle` | `done`/`finished`/`closed` → `completed` | skip REQ at Step 1 with the warning text — never claim or archive an unrecognized status silently |
| `route` (Step 3 dispatch, Step 5 scope-drift comparison) | `A`, `B`, `C` | lowercase `a`/`b`/`c` → uppercase | treat as needing re-triage in Step 3 |
| `caveman` (Step 6 crew load) | `false`, `true`, `lite`, `full`, `ultra` | truthy strings (`yes`/`on`) → `true`; `light` → `lite` | `false` |
| `tdd` (Step 6 testing-crew load, Step 6.5 TDD-evidence gate; emission validated in `actions/capture.md`) | `true`, `false` (YAML boolean) | `test_first`/`yes`/`on`/`t` → `true`; `no`/`off`/`f` → `false` | `false` (Step 6 testing crew not loaded; Step 6.5 gate not enforced) |
| `error_type` (Step 8 failure classification, Step 8 upstream-failure short-circuit, forensics) | `intent`, `spec`, `code`, `environment` | (no common typo aliases identified) | `code` |
| `kb_status` (Step 7.5 / Step 9.5 kb-lessons handoff, roadmap lessons rollup) | `promoted`, `pending`, `declined`, `skipped` | `skip` → `skipped`; `rejected` → `declined` | `pending` |

**Write paths are unaffected.** Step 2 claim, Step 8 archive, Step 8 follow-up generation, the kb-lessons handoff, and capture emission always write the canonical key and canonical enum value — never an alias, never the typo'd input. The normalize-and-warn contract is read-only.

## Crash Recovery (Step 1)

**Crash Recovery:** Before checking the queue, look inside `do-work/working/` for any `REQ-*.md` files. If any exist, a previous run was interrupted. For each recovered REQ:
1. Reset frontmatter: set `status` to `pending`, **unless** the REQ file contains a `## Open Questions` section with at least one unresolved `- [ ]` item — in that case, restore `status` to `pending-answers`. (If the `## Open Questions` section exists but all items are already `[x]` or `[~]`, or if no `## Open Questions` section exists at all, set `status` to `pending`.) Remove `claimed_at` and `route`.
2. Strip sections generated during the interrupted run: remove `## Triage`, `## Exploration`, `## Plan`, `## Scope`, `## Pre-Flight`, `## Implementation Summary`, `## Qualification`, `## Testing`, `## Review`, `## Lessons Learned`, `## Decisions`, and `## Discovered Tasks` sections (and their content) if present — these may be incomplete or stale from the crash. Leave `## Open Questions` and user-authored content intact.
3. Move the REQ back to `do-work/queue/`

Once `working/` is empty, proceed with finding the next request.

## Composed Exit Summary (Step 1)

**Exit paths when no `pending` REQs found:**

The exit report is **composed**, not picked from disjoint branches. Whenever no `pending` REQs are found, lead with `No pending REQs in queue.` and then append every section that has at least one REQ. Three sections may apply, in this order:

1. **Completed/done section** — applies if any REQ in `do-work/queue/` has status `completed`, `completed-with-issues`, or `done`. Read the `user_request` frontmatter field from each to group by UR. Render:

   ```
   ⚠ N completed REQs awaiting archive (UR-137: 3 REQs, UR-138: 1 REQ, ...):
     REQ-351 — [title] (done)
     REQ-352 — [title] (completed)
     ...

   Run `do-work cleanup` to archive completed work, then `do-work recap` to see full history.
   ```

2. **Pending-answers section** — applies if any REQ has status `pending-answers`. Render from frontmatter only — do not open the REQ body to count `## Open Questions` items at this stage (Step 1 reads frontmatter per the queue scan). The count is deferred to `do-work clarify`, which is the action that reads Open Questions sections:

   ```
   ⚠ N REQs awaiting clarification:
     REQ-NNN — [title] (pending-answers)
     ...

   Run `do-work clarify` to batch-review the open questions; resolved REQs flip to `pending` and re-enter the queue.
   ```

3. **Blocked-archive-collision section** — applies if any REQ has status `blocked-archive-collision`. Read the matching archive path from each blocked REQ's frontmatter if recorded; otherwise re-run the Step 2.0 glob (`do-work/archive/**/REQ-NNN-*.md` and `do-work/archive/**/REQ-NNN.md`) to find it. Render:

   ```
   ⚠ N REQs held by archive-collision guard:
     REQ-NNN — [title] (queue file: do-work/queue/REQ-NNN-slug.md)
       already archived at <archive-path>
       recover: rename the queue file (if this is an intentional re-do) or delete it (if it's a stale duplicate), then flip status back to `pending`
     ...
   ```

4. **Blocked-by-dependencies section** — applies if any `pending` REQ has an unmet `depends_on` reference (dependency-blocked) or any REQ has status `blocked-dependency-cycle`. Pending REQs stay `pending` (the gating is dynamic — they become ready as upstream REQs complete); only cycle-detected REQs are flipped to a held status. Render both groups under one heading:

   ```
   ⚠ N REQs blocked by unmet dependencies:
     REQ-NNN — [title] (pending; depends on REQ-MMM, status: <pending|claimed|pending-answers>)
     REQ-PPP — [title] (blocked-dependency-cycle; chain: REQ-PPP → REQ-QQQ → REQ-PPP)
     ...

   Resolve the blocking REQs first, then re-run. To force a scoped run that ignores dependency gating for a specific REQ, use `do-work run REQ-NNN`. To break a dependency cycle, edit the REQ's `depends_on` and flip its status back to `pending`.
   ```

**After rendering all applicable sections, exit the work loop** — do not proceed to Step 2.0 or beyond. There is no `pending` REQ to claim. Step 1's contract on the no-pending path is "render the composed summary, then stop"; the only path that continues is the one where Step 1 finds at least one dependency-ready `pending` REQ.

If **no section applies** (no REQs at all in `do-work/queue/`), report completion and exit. Never silently exit when any of the four sections applies — every non-pending or non-ready REQ in the queue is something the user needs to see.

**Composition is deliberate.** A queue with both `pending-answers` and `blocked-archive-collision` REQs (and no completed/done) renders both sections back-to-back. A queue with all four categories renders all four. The user sees the full picture in one report instead of a single branch's slice.

## Triage Section Template (Step 3)

```markdown
---

## Triage

**Route: [A/B/C]** - [Simple/Medium/Complex]

**Reasoning:** [1-2 sentences]

**Planning:** [Required/Not required]
```

## Plan Template — Route C (Step 4)

```markdown
## Plan

[Plan agent output]

*Generated by Plan agent*
```

## Plan Skip Note — Routes A/B (Step 4)

```markdown
## Plan

**Planning not required** - [Route A: Direct implementation / Route B: Exploration-guided implementation]

*Skipped by work action*
```

## Scope Declaration Template (Step 5.5)

```markdown
## Scope

**Files I will touch:**
- `src/stores/theme-store.ts` (new) — theme state management
- `src/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx` (modify) — add toggle
- `tests/theme-store.test.js` (new) — unit tests

**Files I will NOT touch:** [any files that seem related but are out of scope]

**Acceptance criteria (restated from REQ):**
- [ ] Dark mode toggle visible in settings
- [ ] Theme persists across page reload
- [ ] OS preference respected on first visit
```

## Pre-Flight Template (Step 5.75)

```markdown
## Pre-Flight

**Git:** ⚠ 3 uncommitted files (src/temp.ts, .env.local, notes.md)
**Tests baseline:** ✓ All passing (47 tests)
**Dependencies:** ✓ Installed

*Checked by work action*
```

## Implementation Summary Template (Step 6.25)

```markdown
## Implementation Summary

**Files changed:**
- `src/stores/theme-store.ts` (new)
- `src/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx` (modified)
- `tests/theme-store.test.js` (new)

**What was done:** [1-2 sentences — what the implementation actually did]
```

## Qualification Anti-Rationalization Table (Step 6.3)

| If you're thinking... | STOP. Instead... | Because... |
|---|---|---|
| "The summary says files changed" | Check the file system | The summary is a claim, not evidence |
| "Tests pass so requirements are met" | Compare requirements to diff, word by word | Tests can be incomplete |
| "The builder checked the UNIFY box" | Read the actual diff for debug artifacts | A checked box is a claim, not a fact |
| "This works on my test case" | Test at least 2 additional cases including an edge case | One test case proves nothing about generality |
| "The existing code was already like this" | Flag it in Discovered Tasks | Pre-existing problems are still problems |
| "It's just a small deviation from the plan" | Log it as a Decision (D-XX) | Unlogged deviations break traceability |

## Testing Section Template (Step 6.5)

```markdown
## Testing

**Tests run:** [command]
**Result:** ✓ All passing (X tests)

**Red-green validation:** *(for bug fixes and new features)*
- [test name/file]: ✗ before implementation → ✓ after
- [test name/file]: ✗ before implementation → ✓ after

**New tests added:**
- [list]

**Existing tests updated (cross-REQ impact):**
- [test file] (from REQ-NNN): [what changed and why — intentional behavior change]

*Verified by work action*
```

## Review Section Template (Step 7)

```markdown
## Review

**Overall: [X]%** | [timestamp]

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements | X% |
| Code Quality | X% |
| Test Adequacy | X% |
| Scope | X% |
| Risk | [level] |
| Acceptance | [result] |

**Findings:** [count] important, [count] minor
**Acceptance:** [Pass/Partial/Fail/Untested] — [1-line summary]
**Suggested testing:** [count] items
**Follow-ups created:** [REQ-NNN, REQ-NNN] or "None"

*Reviewed by review work action*
```

## Deferred Prime-Link Path Computation (Step 7.5)

**Path computation rule (for use in Step 8):** the link path must be relative to the prime file's location, not the repo root. Count how many directories deep the prime file sits (i.e., the number of path components before the filename). Prepend that many `../` steps to the REQ's repo-root-relative archive path. Examples:
- Prime at `prime-auth.md` (0 dirs deep) → `do-work/archive/UR-005/REQ-042-auth-fix.md#lessons-learned`
- Prime at `src/utils/prime-auth.md` (2 dirs deep: `src/` and `utils/`) → `../../do-work/archive/UR-005/REQ-042-auth-fix.md#lessons-learned`
- Prime at `web/src/auth/prime-auth.md` (3 dirs deep) → `../../../do-work/archive/UR-005/REQ-042-auth-fix.md#lessons-learned`

The existence-verify check on the resolved path runs in Step 8 (post-move) — that's the whole reason for deferring.

## Builder-Decided Follow-up Template (Step 8)

   ```markdown
   ---
   id: REQ-NNN
   title: "Confirm: [brief description of the choice]"
   status: pending-answers
   created_at: [timestamp]
   user_request: [same UR as the original REQ]
   addendum_to: [original REQ id]
   builder_decided: true
   ---

   # Confirm: [Brief Description]

   ## What
   During [REQ-id], the builder chose [choice] for [question]. This follow-up
   confirms whether that choice matches your intent or if you'd prefer a different approach.

   ## What the Builder Chose
   [Description of the choice and its impact on the implementation]

   ## What Would Change
   [If the user picks a different option, what would need to change]

   ## Open Questions
   - [ ] [Original question]
     Recommended: [builder's choice — already implemented]
     Also: [other alternatives]
   ```

## Discovered Tasks Classification (Step 8)

   The builder should classify each discovered task when appending them:
   ```
   ## Discovered Tasks
   - **[critical]** SQL injection vulnerability in user search endpoint
   - **[normal]** Dead code in utils/legacy-parser.ts can be removed
   - **[low]** Variable naming inconsistency in auth module
   ```

   If the builder did not classify them, the orchestrator classifies based on:
   - **critical**: Security vulnerability, data loss risk, broken functionality in production paths
   - **normal**: Technical debt, missing tests, minor bugs in non-critical paths
   - **low**: Style issues, naming, dead code, documentation gaps

   **For `[critical]` discoveries:** Create follow-up REQ with `status: pending` (not `pending-answers`) — these skip user confirmation and go straight into the work queue. Add a note in Open Questions: `- [x] Auto-approved: critical severity (security/data/production risk). → Added to queue immediately.` Report prominently: `⚠ CRITICAL discovered: [description] — auto-queued as REQ-NNN`

   **For `[normal]` and `[low]` discoveries:** Use the existing `pending-answers` flow:
   - Set frontmatter: `status: pending-answers`, `user_request: [same UR]`, `addendum_to: [current REQ id]`, `domain: [same domain as current REQ]`.
   - Add an `## Open Questions` section with this checkbox format:
     `- [ ] I discovered this out-of-scope task while working on [current REQ]: [Task Description]. Should I process this as a new task?`
     `  Recommended: Yes, add to queue (will flip to 'pending').`
     `  Also: No, discard it.`
   This ensures non-critical discoveries require the user's explicit permission via `do-work clarify` before execution.

## Failure Classification (Step 8)


Before classifying via the symptom table below, **check for upstream failure**. Cascades from a failed prerequisite often present as plausible-looking `code` or `spec` symptoms in the downstream REQ; misclassifying them sends the builder chasing phantom bugs in the wrong domain.

**Upstream-failure short-circuit:**

Read the frontmatter of every REQ this one depends on:
- `addendum_to` (single parent, if set; or `amends`/`parent`/`amendment_to` as the legacy alias if `addendum_to` is absent — same back-compat shape as the `depends_on`/`dependencies:` pair; `addendum_to` wins when multiple are present)
- every entry in `depends_on` (if set, or every entry in the legacy `dependencies:` alias if `depends_on` is absent — same back-compat rule as Step 1; `depends_on` wins when both present)

Resolve each ID by globbing `do-work/archive/**/REQ-NNN-*.md`, `do-work/archive/**/REQ-NNN.md`, `do-work/queue/REQ-NNN-*.md`, and `do-work/working/REQ-NNN-*.md`. If any referenced REQ has `status: failed`, skip the symptom table and short-circuit classification:

- `status: failed`
- `error_type: spec` (the local approach is downstream-correct only if the upstream is correct; with the upstream broken, the local spec is implicitly unsound)
- `error: "Upstream REQ-NNN failed (error_type: <ancestor.error_type>); downstream blocked. Original error: <original error message>"`

Create the follow-up REQ per the Spec row below. It inherits `addendum_to: <this failed REQ>`; the cascade is now visible in the addendum chain and the follow-up's error description names the upstream root cause. The follow-up should also carry the original dependency list so it re-blocks on the same upstream until the upstream's own follow-up lands — and it always emits the canonical `depends_on:` key, even if the failed REQ used the legacy `dependencies:` alias. Don't propagate the alias on follow-ups.

If no upstream REQ is `failed`, fall through to the symptom-based classification table:

| Type | Symptoms | Recovery |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Intent** | Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory; builder couldn't determine what to build | Create a follow-up REQ with `status: pending-answers` containing the specific ambiguities as Open Questions. Archive original as `failed` with `error_type: intent`. |
| **Spec** | Requirements are clear but the technical approach was wrong (wrong files, wrong pattern, wrong architecture) | Create a follow-up REQ with a `## Prior Attempt` section summarizing what was tried and why it failed. Set `status: pending`. Archive original with `error_type: spec`. |
| **Code** | Approach was right but implementation has bugs (tests fail, runtime errors, logic errors) | Create a follow-up REQ targeting the specific code issue. Set `status: pending`. Archive original with `error_type: code`. |
| **Environment** | External dependency unavailable, permissions issue, tooling broken | No follow-up REQ — user must fix the environment. Archive with `error_type: environment` and a clear description of what's needed. |

**Anti-rationalization addition.** When checking the symptom table:

| If you're thinking... | STOP. Instead... | Because... |
|---|---|---|
| "This REQ failed on a code bug" | Check whether any `addendum_to` or `depends_on` ancestor (or `dependencies:` alias) is also `failed` first | Downstream failures often inherit upstream rot; misclassifying as `code` chases phantom bugs in the wrong domain |

**Procedure:**
1. Run the upstream-failure short-circuit. If it fires, jump to step 3.
2. Otherwise classify using the symptom table above.
3. Update frontmatter: `status: failed`, `error: "description"`, `error_type: [intent|spec|code|environment]`
4. For Intent/Spec/Code failures: create the appropriate follow-up REQ (details above). Set `addendum_to` to the failed REQ's ID so context chains. Preserve the original dependency list on the follow-up when the failure was upstream-driven — always emit it under the canonical `depends_on:` key, even if the failed REQ used the legacy `dependencies:` alias.
5. Move to `archive/` (failed REQs always go to archive root, not into UR folders).
6. Report to user: `[REQ-NNN] failed ([type]): [description]. Follow-up: [REQ-NNN] / None.` When the short-circuit fired, prefix the report with `(upstream cascade — original failure at REQ-NNN)`.

## Commit & Metadata-Commit Procedure (Step 9)

```bash
# Stage implementation files + archived REQ
git add src/stores/theme-store.ts src/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx \
  do-work/archive/UR-002/REQ-003-dark-mode.md

# Stage follow-up REQs created in Step 8 (if any)
git add do-work/queue/REQ-025-confirm-sidebar-palette.md

# Stage UR-folder move (if this was the last REQ and the UR moved to archive/)
# Both the old path (deletion) and new path (addition) must be staged.
git add do-work/user-requests/UR-002/ do-work/archive/UR-002/

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[REQ-003] Dark Mode (Route C)

Implements: do-work/archive/UR-002/REQ-003-dark-mode.md

)"
```

**Format:** `[{id}] {title} (Route {route})` + `Implements:` line + summary bullets. Add a co-author trailer if your platform convention calls for one (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Agent <agent@example.com>`), otherwise omit.

One commit per request. Stage all files created, modified, moved, or deleted during this request's lifecycle: implementation files (listed in the Implementation Summary), the archived REQ file, any follow-up REQs created in Step 8 (`pending-answers` files in `do-work/queue/`), and any UR-folder moves to `archive/`. If Step 8 substep 7 wrote prime-file lessons links, the modified prime files must also be staged — they are part of the REQ's lifecycle changes even though they aren't listed in the Implementation Summary's `Files changed`. Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .` — these risk staging secrets, `.env` files, or unrelated changes. Don't bypass pre-commit hooks — fix issues and retry. Failed requests get committed too.

**Validation check (successful REQs only):** Before committing, compare the `## Implementation Summary` file list against the staged files (excluding `do-work/` paths). If the Implementation Summary lists files that aren't staged, or if the only staged files are `do-work/` metadata, flag the mismatch — the commit may not contain the actual implementation. Fix the staging or update the Implementation Summary before proceeding. Design-artifact files placed outside `do-work/` satisfy this check — they are project deliverables. **Skip this check for failed REQs** — they may have no Implementation Summary or no project files staged, and that's expected.

**Write commit hash back to the archived REQ.** After the commit succeeds, retrieve the hash with `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and update the archived REQ's frontmatter `commit:` field with the actual value. Then create a **separate metadata commit** (do not amend — amending changes the hash and invalidates what you just wrote):

```bash
# After the initial commit succeeds:
HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
# Update the commit: field in the archived REQ frontmatter
# (replace "commit:" line or add it if missing)
git add do-work/archive/UR-NNN/REQ-NNN-slug.md
git commit -m "[REQ-NNN] record commit hash ${HASH}"
```

This ensures the `commit:` field in the archived REQ contains the real implementation commit hash, which the review-work and present-work actions depend on for traceability. The metadata commit is a lightweight bookkeeping entry — it does not contain implementation changes.

## Session Checkpoint Template (Step 10)

```markdown
---
session_ended: [timestamp]
last_completed: REQ-NNN
queue_state: [N pending, N pending-answers, N blocked-archive-collision, N in-progress]
reqs_processed_this_session: N
session_depth: light | moderate | heavy

# Session Checkpoint

## Completed This Session
- REQ-NNN: [title] (Route [X], [score]%)
- REQ-NNN: [title] (Route [X], [score]%)

## In Progress (interrupted)
- REQ-NNN: [title] — stopped at [phase: triage/planning/exploring/implementing/testing/reviewing]
  Last known state: [1-2 sentences]
  Key files being modified: [list]
  Known issues: [any blockers or concerns]

## Still Queued
- REQ-NNN: [title] (pending)
- REQ-NNN: [title] (pending-answers — [N] questions)

## Session Notes
[Environment issues, user preferences expressed, patterns discovered, decisions made outside REQ files]

## Context Summary (heavy sessions only)
[Recap of key decisions (D-XX references), architectural patterns encountered, and prime files
that the next session should re-read before starting. Include this section when 6+ REQs were
processed — at that volume, carried-over assumptions are unreliable.]
