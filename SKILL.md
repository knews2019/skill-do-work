# Do-Work Skill

A unified entry point for task capture and processing.

**Actions:**

- **pipeline**: Full end-to-end orchestration → investigate, capture, verify, run, review, present in sequence with persistent state tracking
- **capture requests**: Capture new tasks/requests → creates UR folder (verbatim input) + REQ files (queue items), always paired; for testable behavior, infer and confirm the RED case/GREEN proof target during capture. This is essential, high-value work.
- **verify requests**: Evaluate captured REQs against original input → quality check
- **work**: Process pending requests → executes the queue
- **clarify questions**: Batch-review Open Questions from completed work → user answers, confirms, or skips
- **review work**: Post-work review → requirements check, code review, acceptance testing, and testing suggestions
- **present work**: Client-facing deliverables → briefs, architecture diagrams, value propositions, Remotion videos
- **ai-report**: Self-contained folder report of a completed UR/REQ (`index.html` + `screenshots/`, plus `generated/` for AI images) — live screenshots with SVG callouts, before/after toggles, optional AI-generated diagrams, Mermaid fallback. Output to `ai-reports/`
- **cleanup**: Consolidate archive → moves loose REQs into UR folders, closes completed URs
- **code-review**: Standalone codebase review scoped by prime files and/or directories → consistency, patterns, security, performance, architecture, and risk-driven test coverage
- **quick-wins**: Scan a target directory for obvious refactoring opportunities and low-hanging tests to add
- **scan-ideas**: Generate ideas for what to build, improve, or explore next — grounded in codebase analysis and project history
- **deep-explore**: Multi-round structured exploration of a concept — spawns divergent/convergent subagent dialogue, produces vision documents and idea briefs
- **ui-review**: Validate UI quality against design best practices — read-only audit with structured findings report
- **slop-check**: Validate a human-facing artifact (brief, report, summary) against the anti-slop principles before it ships — read-only by default, optional rewrite on confirmation
- **dream**: Manual four-phase consolidation of a plain-text memory directory — orient, lint, heal, prune + reindex. Destructive; explicit invocation only.
- **install**: Install companion skills/tooling into the current project. Targets: `ui-design` (Anthropic's `frontend-design` skill) and `bowser` (Playwright CLI + Bowser skill for browser automation, screenshots, and visual UI verification).
- **forensics**: Pipeline diagnostics → detects stuck work, hollow completions, orphaned URs, scope contamination (read-only)
- **roadmap**: Queue survey → classifies pending REQs (ready / needs-clarification / blocked / stale), reports TDD posture, rolls up in-progress and recently-completed work (read-only)
- **note**: Append a lightweight, dated next-step hint to `do-work/notes.md` → surfaced at the top of `do-work roadmap`. Not a REQ; no capture, no schema, no implementation. User deletes lines by hand when resolved
- **stray-check**: Repo-wide orphan/junk scan → temp/backup/OS files, committed build artifacts, should-be-gitignored, misplaced/duplicate/empty files, large blobs, AI scratch, best-effort dead code (report-only by default; fixes on confirmation)
- **prime**: Create and audit prime files — AI context documents that index utility codebases
- **build knowledge base (bkb)**: LLM Knowledge Base builder → initialize, triage, ingest, query, lint, and maintain a persistent Markdown wiki compiled from raw sources
- **interview**: Run a structured elicitation interview against a prescriptive template → produces agent-ready operating artifacts (USER.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, plus machine-readable exports). First template: `work-operating-model`.
- **prompts**: Run reusable prompts from the library → `list`, `show <name>`, `run <name>`; extensible collection of battle-tested prompts for recurring jobs
- **commit**: Commit uncommitted files → analyzes, groups atomically, traces to REQs
- **inspect**: Explain uncommitted changes — what changed, why, and whether it's ready to commit (read-only)
- **version**: Show current version, last 5 releases, or check for upstream updates
- **recap**: Summary of last 5 completed user requests with their REQs
- **tutorial**: Interactive tutorials — quick start, concepts, workflow recipes, or guided tour

> **Core concept:** The capture requests action always produces both a UR folder (preserving the original input) and REQ files (the queue items). Each REQ links back to its UR via `user_request` frontmatter. This pairing is mandatory for all requests — simple or complex.

> **Trail of Intent.** This skill doesn't just produce code — it produces a documented trail of *intent*. Every REQ records what the user wanted, why, and what "done" looks like — validated with the user during capture. As the REQ moves through the pipeline, builder decisions, scope declarations, and implementation notes are appended. The result is a living document tracing from original intent through every decision to final implementation. The UR preserves the verbatim request; the REQ preserves the validated, structured intent; the appended sections preserve how intent was realized. This trail is the skill's primary value — code is the side effect. Builder decisions during Step 6 implementation are guided by always-loaded behavioral guardrails (`crew-members/karpathy.md`): think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution.

> **Capture ≠ Execute.** The capture requests action captures requests. The work action executes them. These are strictly separate operations. After capture finishes writing files and reporting back, **STOP**. Do not start processing the queue, do not begin implementation, do not "helpfully" transition into the work action. The user decides when to execute — always. The only exception is if the user explicitly says something like "add this and then run it" or "capture this and start working" in the same invocation.

> **Human time has two optimal windows.** The system is designed to maximize the value of human attention:
>
> 1. **Capture phase** (capture requests action) — The user is present, actively thinking about the request. This is the best time for back-and-forth: clarifying ambiguities, resolving contradictions, making scope decisions. Use the ask tool if your environment provides one; otherwise use your environment's normal ask-user prompt/tool. Every question must present concrete options — never open-ended "what do you mean?" prompts.
>
> 2. **Batch question review** (clarify questions action) — After the build phase completes everything it can without feedback, any remaining `pending-answers` REQs are surfaced as a batch. The user reviews all builder-decided questions together, confirms or adjusts, and resolved REQs re-enter the queue.
>
> Between these windows, the build phase runs autonomously. Builders never block on Open Questions — they mark them `- [~]` with best-judgment reasoning and create `pending-answers` follow-ups when they return via `do-work clarify`.

## Routing Decision

### Step 1: Parse the Input

Examine what follows "do-work":


Check these patterns **in order** — first match wins:

| Priority | Pattern                  | Example                                                                                                                            | Route                         |

### Step 2: Preserve Payload

**Critical rule**: Never lose the user's content.

**Single-word rule**: A single word is either a known keyword or ambiguous — it is never "descriptive content."

- **Matches a keyword** in the routing table (e.g., "version", "verify", "cleanup") → route to that action directly.
- **Doesn't match any keyword** (e.g., "refactor", "optimize") → ambiguous. Ask: "Do you want to add '`{word}`' as a new request, or did you mean something else?"

Only route to **capture requests** when the input is clearly descriptive — multiple words, a sentence, a feature request, etc.

If routing is genuinely unclear AND multi-word content was provided:

- Default to **capture requests** (adding a task)
- Hold onto $ARGUMENTS
- If truly ambiguous, ask: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
- User replies with just "add" or "work" → proceed with original content

### Verb Reference

| Route | Trigger verbs | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **pipeline** | pipeline, full, full pipeline | Everything after keyword → `$ARGUMENTS` (request text). "pipeline status" → status mode. "pipeline abandon" → abandon mode. If no args and active pipeline exists, resume. |
| **work** | run, go, start, begin, work, process, execute, build, continue, resume | Optional REQ IDs after keyword (e.g., `do-work run REQ-042`) → process only those REQs. No args → work through full queue (dependency-aware order). Flag (default mode only): `--wave N` runs only REQs at dependency depth N. Strip the flag before extracting REQ IDs. `--wave` and explicit REQ IDs are mutually exclusive — reject with a clear error. An argument that is neither a `REQ-NNN` ID nor `--wave N` is **rejected** with a usage error — it is **not** treated as "no args" (which would silently build the whole queue). See `actions/work.md` Input → "Unrecognized arguments are rejected, not ignored." |
| **clarify** | clarify, answers, questions, pending, pending answers, blocked, what's blocked, what needs answers | Routes to `actions/clarify.md` |
| **verify requests** | verify, verify requests, check, evaluate, review requests, review reqs, audit | "check" alone → verify; "check for updates" → version (priority 2); "audit" alone → verify; "audit codebase" → code-review; "audit primes" → prime |
| **code-review** | code-review, code review, review codebase, audit codebase, codebase review | Both hyphenated and unhyphenated forms route here, with or without scope. Scope args: prime file refs, directory paths, or combined |
| **ui-review** | ui-review, review ui, design review, validate ui, ui audit, design audit | Do NOT use "check ui" — consumed by verify at priority 5. Scope args: file paths, directory paths, prime file refs |
| **review work** | review, review work, review code, audit code, audit implementation, review REQ-NNN | "review requests" / "review reqs" → verify (priority 5), not here. "code review" → code-review (priority 7), not here |
| **present work** | present, present work, showcase, deliver, pitch, client brief | No target → most recent UR. "present all" → portfolio mode |
| **ai-report** | ai-report, ai report, make-report, make report, screenshot-report, visual report, proof of work | Self-contained folder report (`index.html` + `screenshots/`/`generated/`) with screenshots + SVG callouts + before/after + optional AI-generated diagrams; output to `ai-reports/`. Target arg: `UR-NNN`, `REQ-NNN`, "most recent", or empty. Distinct from present-work (educational explainer) and pipeline's `.single.html` (multi-REQ debrief) |
| **cleanup** | cleanup, clean up, tidy, consolidate, organize archive, fix archive | **Archive consolidation only.** A `clean up` / `consolidate` / `cleanup` that names **memory / wiki / notes** is the dream action (priority 28); one that names **stray / orphan / junk files** or repo pollution is the stray-check action (priority 29). Evaluate those carve-outs first; a bare verb with no memory/wiki/notes/junk target stays here. |
| **commit** | commit, commit changes, commit files, save changes, save work | |
| **inspect** | inspect, inspect changes, explain changes, what changed, show changes, describe changes | "what changed" (no apostrophe) → inspect; "what's changed" → version |
| **recap** | recap | Routes to version action with `mode: recap` |
| **version** | version, update, check for updates, what's new, release notes, what's changed, updates, history | "updates" (plural) shows last 5 releases; "update" (singular) triggers update check |
| **forensics** | forensics, diagnose, health check, health | |
| **roadmap** | roadmap, queue-status, where are we, what's left, what's feasible, what should I work on next | Optional scope: `pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `UR-NNN`, or `since <date>`. Read-only. `"<action> status"` → that action (e.g., "pipeline status" → pipeline, "bkb status" → bkb, "interview <template> status" → interview). |
| **note** | note, note add, add note | Everything after the keyword → `$ARGUMENTS` (the note text). Strips a leading `add `; appends `- [YYYY-MM-DD] text` to `do-work/notes.md` (creates it on first use). Not a capture — no UR/REQ, no work loop, no commit. |
| **stray-check** | stray files, strays, orphan files, orphans, junk, what doesn't belong, file hygiene, stray-check | Repo-wide file hygiene (NOT do-work's own files — that's cleanup). Optional path scope; `fix` to apply fixes on confirmation, `report` to force read-only. Bare "clean up" / "consolidate" stays cleanup (priority 11). |
| **prime** | prime, prime create, prime audit, create prime, audit primes, primes | Everything after verb → `$ARGUMENTS`. "audit primes" → prime; plain "audit" → verify |
| **bkb** | bkb, build knowledge base, knowledge base, kb | Everything after verb → `$ARGUMENTS` (sub-command + params) |
| **interview** | interview, elicit, operating model | Everything after verb → `$ARGUMENTS` (`list`, `<template>`, or `<template> <sub-command>`). No args → help menu |
| **prompts** | prompts, prompt | Everything after verb → `$ARGUMENTS` (sub-command + prompt name + args). `prompts` (plural) and `prompt` (singular) both route here. First arg is the sub-command (`list`, `show`, `run`) or a prompt name (shorthand for `run`) |
| **quick-wins** | quick-wins, quick wins, low-hanging, low hanging fruit, scan, opportunities, what can we improve | "scan" alone or with a bare directory path → quick-wins; bare path = last meaningful token (any text after it is descriptive content → capture) |
| **install** | install, install ui-design, install-ui-design, install ui design, install ui, install frontend-design, setup ui design, setup design skill, install bowser, install-bowser, install playwright, install playwright-cli, setup bowser, setup playwright | **Normalize the invocation first**, then extract the target token: (a) strip a leading `install-` from hyphenated forms (`install-ui-design` → `ui-design`, `install-bowser` → `bowser`); (b) strip a leading `setup ` (`setup bowser` → `bowser`, `setup ui design` → `ui design`); (c) for `install X` with a space, take everything after `install `. Then map the normalized token: `ui-design`/`ui design`/`ui`/`frontend-design`/`design skill` → target `ui-design`; `bowser`/`playwright`/`playwright-cli` → target `bowser`. Pass the target as `$ARGUMENTS`. Bare `install` with no token (or unknown target after normalization) → help block. |
| **scan-ideas** | scan-ideas, ideate, ideas, brainstorm, what should I build, suggest, what's next, what could we improve | Everything after keyword → `$ARGUMENTS` (focus topic or directory). No args → open exploration |
| **deep-explore** | deep-explore, explore concept, deep dive, develop idea, explore idea | Everything after keyword → `$ARGUMENTS` (concept, file path, topic, or "continue"). No args → ask user what to explore |
| **tutorial** | tutorial, tutorial quick-start, tutorial concepts, tutorial recipes, tutorial tour, learn, getting started, how does this work | Everything after "tutorial" → `$ARGUMENTS` (mode). No args → ask user which mode |
| **slop-check** | slop-check, slop check, anti-slop | Everything after the verb → `$ARGUMENTS` (file path, REQ/UR ID, "most recent", or empty). Triggers must be distinctive — any `check ...` form (e.g., "check slop", "check draft", "check for slop") collides with verify priority 5 and is intentionally not listed here. |
| **dream** | dream, consolidate memory, clean up wiki, lint and merge notes, memory cleanup | Everything after the verb → `$ARGUMENTS` (memory directory path or empty). No path → auto-resolve default (`./memory`, `./wiki`, `./kb/wiki`, `./knowledge-base/wiki`). Single-word `dream` is a known keyword, not descriptive content. These memory/wiki/notes phrases take precedence over the generic cleanup verbs (priority 11) even though Dream sits lower in the table. |
| **capture requests** | `capture request:` prefix, descriptive text, feature requests, bug reports, "add", "create", "I need", "we should" | Default for multi-word descriptive content that doesn't match any keyword |

## Examples

### Help Menu (bare invocation)

When invoked with no arguments or with `help` (`do-work`, `do-work help`), show a help menu with available actions and example prompts:

```

  Tip: add "help" to any command for details — e.g. do-work commit help
```

Do not ask "Start the work loop?" — just print the help menu and wait.

### Per-Command Help

When any action is invoked with `help` as its sole argument (e.g., `do-work commit help`, `do-work inspect help`), show a brief usage summary instead of executing the action.

**Actions with built-in help** (`pipeline`, `prime`, `bkb`): dispatch normally — they handle `help` internally.

**All other actions**: read the action file and present a compact summary:

```
<action-name> — <description from the blockquote>

  Usage:
    do-work <action> [args]       <brief description>

  Arguments:
    <list accepted arguments/modes from the action file's Input section>

  Examples:
    <2-3 example invocations>
```

Keep it short — no more than 15 lines. The goal is quick orientation, not a tutorial. After showing the summary, stop — do not execute the action.

## Payload Preservation Rules

When clarification is needed but content was provided:

1. **Do not lose $ARGUMENTS** - keep the full payload in context
2. **Ask a simple question**: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
3. **Accept minimal replies**: User says just "add" or "work"
4. **Proceed with original content**: Apply the chosen action to the stored arguments
5. **Never ask the user to re-paste content**

This enables a two-phase commit pattern:

1. Capture intent payload
2. Confirm action

## Action Dispatch

Each action has an action file with full instructions. How you execute it depends on your environment's capabilities.

| Action             | Action file                     | Context to pass                |

### If subagents are available

Dispatch each action to a subagent. The subagent reads the action file and executes it — the main thread only sees the routing decision and the returned summary.

- **`work`**: Run in the background if your environment supports it. Print a status line (e.g., "Work queue processing in background...") and return control to the user immediately.
- **`cleanup`**: Run in the background if your environment supports it. Print a status line and return control to the user immediately.
- **Exception — pipeline dispatch**: When the pipeline action dispatches `work`, it runs in the **foreground** (blocking). The pipeline requires each step to complete before advancing. This override applies only when the pipeline is the caller.
- **`pipeline`, `capture requests`, `clarify questions`, `verify requests`, `review work`, `code-review`, `ui-review`, `present work`, `ai-report`, `slop-check`, `dream`, `quick-wins`, `scan-ideas`, `deep-explore`, `prime`, `forensics`, `roadmap`, `note`, `stray-check`, `commit`, `inspect`, `install`, `version`, `recap`, `tutorial`, `prompts`, `interview`**: Run in the foreground (blocking). These need user interaction or produce small immediate output.
- **Screenshots (`capture requests` only):** Subagents can't see images from the main conversation. Before dispatching, save screenshots to `do-work/user-requests/.pending-assets/screenshot-{n}.png`, write a text description of each, and include the paths + descriptions in the subagent prompt.

### If subagents are not available

Read the action file directly and follow its instructions in the current session. The action files are designed to work as standalone prompts — no subagent infrastructure required.

### On failure

Report the error to the user. Do not retry automatically.

## Suggest Next Steps

After every action completes, suggest the next logical prompts the user might want to run. See [`next-steps.md`](./next-steps.md) for the full per-action reference (what to suggest after each action, formatting rules, and constraints).
